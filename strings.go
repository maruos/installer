Welcome to the Maru installer!

In order to install Maru you will need to:

1. Connect your device to your computer over USB

2. Enable USB Debugging on your device:

    1)  Go to the Settings app and scroll down to
        the System section

        NOTE: If you already have "Developer options"
        under System then go directly to #5

    2)  Tap on "About phone"
    3)  Tap "Build number" 7 times until you get a message
        that says you are now a developer
    4)  Go back to the main Settings app
    5)  Tap on "Developer options"
    6)  Ensure that "USB debugging" is enabled
    7)  Tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you to allow
        USB Debugging for your computer's RSA key fingerprint

WARNING: Installing Maru will wipe all your personal data
so make sure you first back-up anything important!

const MsgIncompleteZip = `
Hmm, looks like your installer is a missing a few things.

Are you running this install script outside the directory you unzipped the installer in?

Please ensure that:

1. Your device is connected to your computer over USB
2. You have USB Debugging enabled (see above for instructions)
3. You unlock your device and tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you
   to allow USB Debugging for your computer's RSA key fingerprint

If you are on Windows, please ensure you have the Google USB Driver properly
installed for your device as described in HELP.txt (this is the main source of

Go ahead and re-run the installer when you're ready.

It looks like you are missing some USB permissions.

Please follow the instructions below depending on your platform:

Linux
-----

On certain Linux distributions (Ubuntu 14.04 for example), you will need to
explicitly add permissions to access USB devices:

1. Disconnect your device from USB

2. Run this in a terminal (requires sudo):

   $ wget -S -O - https://source.android.com/source/51-android.txt | sed "s/<username>/$USER/" | sudo tee >/dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules; sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

3. Re-connect your device over USB and re-run this installer

Windows
-------

Please ensure you have the Google USB Driver properly installed for your device
as described in HELP.txt (this is the main source of problems on Windows!)

`

const MsgUnlockSuccess = `
Successfully unlocked bootloader!

Your device will need to reboot before continuing. It will factory reset, so
this reboot can take a few minutes longer than usual.

To continue the installation process, please re-run this script after your
device completely boots up and you have re-enabled USB Debugging.
`

const MsgSuccess = `
Installation complete!

The first boot will take 2-3 mins as Maru sets up your device so please be
patient.

Rebooting into Maru...
